                        coordinated by our main mentor Daniela Lica, a computer – programming teacher.
                        Our team is composed of 15 members and 3 volunteers and each of them is currently
                        working in the STEM fields with extracurricular activities which fit their sub-teams.
                        Our team started with no budget and has been gradually building up its financial
                        resources.

                        “infO(1)Robotics” Team started as a group of students having the same desires,
                        wishes and expectations in relation to the core and foundations of FTC and of
                        robotics as a whole field of mind and soul.
                        Our opinion regarding FTC is that it represents a perfect way for each and every one
                        of us to display and develop their skills in a competitive and educative environment
                        that FTC offers towards its outlines, management and Gracious Professionalism.
                        Our whole experience in FTC revolves around this core value of the competition
                        because we sure believe that adopting such an attitude is a great way for us not only
                        to perform better during FTC, but also to realize that we may become better people
                and colleagues, no matter the context or situation.</div>
